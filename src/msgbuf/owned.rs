/// Owned buffers for use with [`MsgBuf`](super::MsgBuf).
///
/// Implementors can only be characterized by their three properties they're constructed from and
/// deconstructed into:
/// - Base pointer, the start of the buffer and the handle for reallocation and deallocation
/// - Capacity, the length of the buffer
/// - Initialization cursor, the number of bytes at the beginning of the buffer which can be assumed
///   to be well-initialized, and are to be retained when growing
///
/// # Contract
/// ## Logic
///  - For an `OwnedBuf` with init cursor ùëñ, after a call to `.grow()`, the first ùëñ bytes starting
///   from the base pointer must match the corresponding values before the call. In other words,
///   growth must retain the contents of the initialized part.
/// - The initialization cursor position must not spuriously decrease.
/// - `.grow()` must increase the buffer's capacity to the given new capacity. It *may* decrease the
///   capacity if the new value is lower than the current capacity.
///
/// ## Safety
/// - For an `OwnedBuf` with capacity ùëê, the first ùëê bytes starting from the base pointer must be
///   valid for reads of `MaybeUninit<u8>` given a shared reference to it and writes given an
///   exclusive reference.
/// - The buffer must not become invalidated unless its drop code is called. In particular, allowing
///   a buffer placed in [`ManuallyDrop`](core::mem::ManuallyDrop) to go out of scope may not
///   deallocate or otherwise invalidate the buffer.
///     - The base pointer may only change as a result of `.grow()`. It must not change on any other
///       occasion.
/// - Capacity must not spuriously decrease.

    /// # Safety
    /// - If `cap` is non-zero, `ptr` must be a value returned by an `into_raw_parts()` call on the
