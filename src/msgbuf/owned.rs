/// - Base pointer, the start of the buffer and the handle for reallocation and deallocation
/// - Capacity, the length of the buffer
/// - Initialization cursor, the number of bytes at the beginning of the buffer which can be assumed
///   to be well-initialized, and are to be retained when growing
///
/// # Safety
/// - For an `OwnedBuf` with capacity ùëê, the first ùëê bytes starting from the base pointer must be
///   valid for reads of `MaybeUninit<u8>` given a shared reference to it and writes given an
///   exclusive reference.
/// - The base pointer may not change unless `.grow()` is called.
/// - Capacity may not spuriously decrease.
/// - For an `OwnedBuf` with init cursor ùëñ, after a call to `.grow()`, the first ùëñ bytes starting
///   from the base pointer must match the corresponding values before the call. In other words,
///   growth must retain the contents of the initialized part.
